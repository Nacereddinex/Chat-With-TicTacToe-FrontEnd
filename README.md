# Tic-Tac-Toe Game and Chat App
This project is a full-stack application that combines a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a real-time chat function. The front-end is built using React.js, allowing users to play the game and communicate with each other in a chat interface. The back-end server is a separate Node.js server, which handles the game logic and manages real-time communication using sockets.

## Features
### Tic-Tac-Toe Game: 
Users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in a web-based interface. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid, and it automatically detects and displays the winner or a tie.

### Real-Time Chat: 
The application includes a chat feature where players can communicate with each other in real-time. The chat interface allows users to send messages, which are instantly displayed to all connected players.

## Project Structure

This project is split into two separate repositories:

* Front-end (React.js):  
Contains the client-side code responsible for rendering the game and chat interface. The front-end repository can be found at front-end-repository-link.

* Back-end (Node.js):   
Manages the game logic and handles real-time communication using sockets. The back-end repository can be found at back-end-repository-link.

## Limitations
* Design: The current design of the application might be basic and lacking visual appeal. It focuses on functionality rather than aesthetics.

## Future Improvements
* Responsiveness: Enhance the application's responsiveness to ensure it works well on different devices and screen sizes. Implement a responsive design that adapts to various viewport sizes.

* User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow players to register, log in, and have personalized profiles. This can enable features such as persistent game history, user statistics, and friend invitations.

* Game Variations: Extend the game to support different variations of Tic-Tac-Toe, such as larger grid sizes, different win conditions, or additional game modes.

* Improved Chat Functionality: Add features to the chat functionality, such as the ability to send emojis, or file attachments.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the front-end repository: git clone [https://github.com/Nacereddinex/Chat-With-TicTacToe-FrontEnd]

Clone the back-end repository: git clone [https://github.com/Nacereddinex/Chat-WIth-TicTactoe-Backend]

Install the dependencies for both repositories with npm install

Start the back-end server with npm start
Start the front-end ReactJs Application : npm start
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
